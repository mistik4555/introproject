# General analysis of game on Steam platform<br />
In this project i will analyze for 27000 games on Steam<br />
The dataset taken from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/nikdavis/steam-store-games<br />
Since dataset is clean i didn't consider webscrapping. That data was taken in 2019.<br />
The following data used for analysis: id, name, developer, genres, categories, average playtime, ratings, reqired age, price and etc.<br />
